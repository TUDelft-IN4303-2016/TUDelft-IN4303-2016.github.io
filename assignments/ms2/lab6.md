In this lab, you develop a test suite for type analysis.
The test suite consists of type projection test cases, resolution test cases and constraint test cases.

## Overview

### Objectives

Develop a test suite for type analysis.
The test suite should provide

1. Test cases for the types of expressions
1. Test cases for the resolution of method names
2. Test cases for
  * errors on duplicate method definitions
  * errors on missing method definitions
  * errors on overloaded methods
  * errors on cyclic inheritance
  * errors on fields hiding fields in a parent class
  * warnings on variables hiding fields in a parent class
  * notes on overriding methods
  * type errors in expressions (except for new array and array subscript expressions)
  * type errors in statements
  * type errors in method definitions

### Submission

You need to submit your test project with a pull request against branch `assignment7` on GitHub.
The [Git documentation](/documentation/git.html#submitting-an-assignment) explains how to file such a request.

Test files created during this lab should go into the `MiniJava-tests-types` project.
{: .notice .notice-warning}

The deadline for submissions is November 15th, 23:59. Once you score 50 points or more in early feedback, this deadline is extended to November 29th, 23:59.
{: .notice .notice-warning}

### Grading

You can earn up to 100 points for the coverage of your test cases. Therefor, we run your test cases against 48 correct and erroneous definitions of MiniJava. The total number of points depends on how many erroneous language you detect in each of the following groups:

- Names (30 points)
  - Classes (2 points)
  - Methods (25 points)
  - Hiding (3 points)
- Types (70 points)
  - Expressions (44 points)
  - Statements (26 points)

It is important to name tests in a testsuite uniquely. Tests in different test suites can have the same name, but for grading, we need to be able to distinguish tests in the same test suite by their name.
{: .notice .notice-warning}

### Early Feedback

We provide early feedback for the effectiveness of your test cases.
This feedback gives you an indication which parts of the name binding rules might still be uncovered by your tests.
It includes a summary on how many erroneous language definitions you reveal and how many points you earn by detecting them.
You have 5 early feedback attempts.

## Detailed Instructions

### Preliminaries

#### Git Repository

You continue with your work from the previous assignment.
See the [Git documentation](/documentation/git.html#continue-from-previous-assignment) on how to create the `assignment7` branch from your previous work.

#### Initial Test Project

Import the `MiniJava-tests-types` projects into Eclipse if you have not already done so:

1. right-click into the Package Explorer
2. select **Import...** from the context menu
3. choose **General/Existing Projects into Workspace** from the list
4. select the project to import
5. press the **Finish** button

### Testing Types of Expressions

In test cases for type analysis,
 you write syntactically correct programs and
 mark expressions with inner square bracket blocks.
You can then specify the expected type of the marked expression in a `run x to y` clause.
For example, the following two test cases require an integer literal to be of type `Int()`
and a variable reference to be of its declared type `Bool()`:

```
module types

language MiniJava
start symbol Program

test integer literal type [[
  class Main {
    public static void main (String[] args) {
      System.out.println([[1]]);
    }
  }
]] run get-type to Int()

test variable reference type [[
  class Main {
    public static void main (String[] args) {
      System.out.println(new Foo().run());
    }
  }

  class Foo {
    public int run() {
      boolean x;
      int y;

      if ([[x]])
        y = 1;
      else
        y = 0;

      return y;
    }
  }
]] run get-type to Bool()
```

You can use `setup` headers and footers to avoid repeating parts in similar test cases. See the [SPT documentation](http://metaborg.org/spt/#setup-blocks) for details.

When applying `get-type` to objects, the expected `ClassType` constructor also requires annotations.
These annotations should be added to the constructor using a wild card as done below.

```
test expression id type [[
  class Foobar {
    Foo x;
    public Foo method() {
      return [[x]];
    }
  }
]] run get-type to ClassType("Foo"{_})
```

You should come up with test cases for the types of all kinds of expressions.
Just like previous testing assignments, this assignment is all about the coverage of your test suite.

Array creation and array subscript expressions cannot be tested because of a bug in SPT.
{: .notice .notice-warning}

Make sure that there are no errors in tests with a `run x to y` clause. These tests are invalid when there are errors.

Do not use start symbols other than `Program`.

### Testing Method Name Resolution

We did not test method names in assignment 5, since method name resolution requires type analysis.
Types are available now, so we can test method name resolution.
Consider the following test case as an example:

```
test method name resolution [[
  class Main {
    public static void main (String[] args) {
      System.out.println(new Foo().[[run]]());
    }
  }

  class Foo {
    public int [[run]]() {
      return 1;
    }
  }
]] resolve #1 to #2
```

The type of the callee expression determines the class in which the method declaration can be found.
In this example, the expression `new Foo()` is of type `ClassType("Foo"{_})` and
the corresponding class `Foo` contains a method declaration for `run()`.

You should come up with test cases for the resolution of method names.
Start with simple test cases, but keep in mind that method name resolution is quite complex
 and that coverage is the main criterion for your grade.
It is important to think about forward and backward references,
 resolution in the presence of homonyms and overriding,
 and the influence of class hierarchies on resolution.

You should also come up with test cases for error checking on method names.
This should include test cases for errors on duplicate definitions, missing definitions, and method overloading
 as well as for notes on method overriding.
Similar to previous test cases, you can pair up positive (`0 errors`) and negative test cases.

Make sure that there are no errors in tests with a `resolve x to y` clause. These tests are invalid when there are errors.
{: .notice .notice-warning}

### Testing notes

Notes are notices that display some information.
Testing notes is similar to testing errors, add a `x notes` clause to a test to expect notes in the test fragment.

Make sure that there are no errors in tests with a `x notes` clause. These tests are invalid when there are errors.
{: .notice .notice-warning}

### Testing Type Error Checking

A type error occurs, when the type of an expression does not conform to its expected type.
Consider the following test case as an example:

```
test print boolean [[
  class Main {
    public static void main (String[] args) {
      System.out.println(true);
    }
  }
]] 1 error
```

In MiniJava, `System.out.println()` can only print integers.
Thus, there should be an error on `true`, when we pass it to the print statement.
Similarly, type errors can occur in other statements, expressions, and method declarations.
You should come up with test cases for such errors.
Subtyping is a common source for errors not only in programs, but also in language implementations.
It is therefore important to have positive and negative typing tests, which involve correct and incorrect subtyping.

Again, keep in mind that coverage is the main criterion for your grade.

### Number of errors

Similar to the previous testing lab, it is important to specify the exact number of errors in `x errors` tests for grading to work correctly.
You need to make sure that your program does not contain any other errors.

For duplicate method definitions, you get an error for every definition of the same name.
For missing method definitions, you get an error for every unresolved reference.
For overloaded method definitions, you get an error for every overloaded definition in the same class.
And for cyclic inheritance, you get an error for every class definition in the cycle.

Interaction between names and types give rise to more complex cases.
Unresolved references cause an error, but also cascade into the surrounding expression or statement, because the reference is untyped, resulting in 2 errors in total.
In addition, unresolved method references create an additional error because the arguments cannot be checked, resulting in 3 errors in total.
For assignments, when the left hand side is unresolved, there is an unresolved error and an additional error because the right hand side cannot be checked, resulting in 2 errors in total.

Literal, unary, and binary expressions do not cascade errors, because their type is always known.
